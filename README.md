## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v18` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd aqie-front-end
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment variables (.env)

This project reads environment variables via `dotenv`. For local development:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. At minimum, set `OS_NAMES_API_KEY` to enable UK location lookups (Ordnance Survey Names API):

```env
OS_NAMES_API_KEY=your_os_names_key_here
```

3. Optional variables (proxies, NI OAuth for testing NI flows, feature toggles) are documented in `.env.example`.

You can still export variables in your shell if you prefer; `.env` is simply a convenience for local runs and tests.

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you update `.env`, restart the dev server to pick up changes.

### Local JSON API

Whilst the APIs are being developed this app uses a local JSON mock API. To start this locally run:

```bash
npm run mockApi
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

## Docker

### Development image

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag aqie-front-end:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 aqie-front-end:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
