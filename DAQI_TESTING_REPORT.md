---

## üü† **HIGH Range Testing (Values 7, 8, 9)**

### **DAQI Value 7 (High - Low)**

- **Band**: `high`
- **Advice**: "Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors."
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **PASS** - Clear escalation from moderate to high concern level

### **DAQI Value 8 (High - Mid)**

- **Band**: `high`
- **At-Risk Groups**:
  - **Adults**: "Adults with heart problems should reduce strenuous physical exertion..."
  - **Asthma**: "People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often."
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **PASS** - Stronger restrictions than moderate range

### **DAQI Value 9 (High - High)**

- **Band**: `high`
- **Elderly Advice**: "Older people should reduce physical exertion."
- **Outlook**: "Warm temperatures are expected to increase pollution levels to high..."
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **PASS** - Maximum high-range restrictions

---

## üî¥ **VERY HIGH Range Testing (Value 10)**

### **DAQI Value 10 (Very High)**

- **Band**: `veryHigh`
- **Readable Band**: `very high`
- **Advice**: "Reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as cough or sore throat."
- **At-Risk Groups** (Most Restrictive):
  - **Adults**: "Adults with heart problems should **avoid** strenuous physical activity."
  - **Asthma**: "People with asthma may need to use their reliever inhaler more often."
  - **Elderly**: "Older people should **avoid** strenuous physical activity."
- **Outlook**: "The current heatwave shows no signs of relenting, causing air pollution levels to remain very high..."
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **PASS** - Maximum restriction level with "avoid" language

---

## üìè **Responsive Design Integration Testing**

### **Visual Positioning Verification**

- ‚úÖ All 10 DAQI segments properly positioned
- ‚úÖ Last segment (Value 10) correctly sized at **100px width** vs 50px for others
- ‚úÖ Moderate values (4,5,6) positioned in segments 4-6
- ‚úÖ High values (7,8,9) positioned in segments 7-9
- ‚úÖ Very High value (10) positioned in final segment

### **CSS Divider Calculations**

- **Divider 1** (after Low range): `156px`
- **Divider 2** (after Moderate range): `315px`
- **Divider 3** (after High range): `474px`
- ‚úÖ Dividers correctly separate the tested ranges

### **Responsive Behavior**

- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness simulated (320px width)
- ‚úÖ Desktop responsiveness simulated (590px width)
- ‚úÖ JavaScript column calculations verified for all target values

## üîÑ **Escalating Severity Verification**

### **Advice Progression Analysis**

```
Moderate (5): "Adults who have heart problems and feel unwell should CONSIDER doing less..."
High (8):     "Adults with heart problems should REDUCE strenuous physical exertion..."
Very High (10): "Adults with heart problems should AVOID strenuous physical activity."
```

**Progression**: `CONSIDER ‚Üí REDUCE ‚Üí AVOID` ‚úÖ **Correctly Escalating**
